== Description ==

Konkr checks your comments against the Konkr web service to see if they look like spam or not and lets you
review the spam it catches under your blog's "Comments" admin screen.


PS: You'll need an KonKr API key to use it. Keys are free - as free beer - for all type of blogs (personals, businesses and commercial sites).

PS2: This plugin is a fork of Akismet Wordpress Plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/)

== Installation ==

1 - Upload the Akismet plugin to your blog onto wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2 - Activate it via "admin->plugins" menu.
3 - Enter your Konkr API key: http://konkr.com/get/.
4 - There's no fourth step.

That's all !
